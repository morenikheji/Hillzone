                  <h3>A SHARED STRATEGIC VISION</h3>
<p>We invest with management teams that are passionate about their business and have a strategic vision for how to maximize its potential. We spend considerable time helping management refine and expand the strategies required to achieve their vision. These efforts and our ability to identify and partner with talented managers have served as the foundation of our success.</p>
<h3>VALUE-ADDED SUPPORT &amp; INDUSTRY INSIGHTS</h3>
<p>Pollux works closely with management to accelerate growth and drive value creation. We provide management with the capital, strategic advice,acquisition/financing support, industry expertise, and other resources necessary to help build shareholder value. We maintain a robust network of industry-specific and value-added professionals, who can aid in executing organic and M&amp;A-based growth initiatives.</p>
<h3><br></h3><h3>ACTIVE OWNERSHIP WITHOUT INTERFERENCE</h3>
<p>While serving as active board members and proactively supporting each of our management teams, we do not look to interfere in the day-to-day operations of our portfolio companies. We recognize that every business and team is unique and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. We look for ways to work with our partners when and where they need help the most.</p>
<h3>REWARDING VALUE CREATION</h3>
<p>In addition to constructing a competitive current compensation package, Pollux offers management teams a significant equity-based compensation program that provides meaningful economic rewards as value is created. This structure most appropriately aligns incentives over time and provides management with the ability to truly benefit from their efforts.</p>
